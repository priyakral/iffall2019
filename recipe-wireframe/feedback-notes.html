		<h1>Feedback Notes on Recipe Wireframe</h1>
			<h2>Recipe Wireframe by Priya Kral</h2>
			<h3>Critique by Alex Koehl</h3>

		<h3>Feedback:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Make the width of the boxes the width of the images, or consider fully breaking the grid and using full bleed. Awkward width right now that does not align.</li>
			<li>Some content needs more labels, like the intro paragraph. Content awkward without any labeling.</li>
			<li>Serving size is helpful but needs a more relevant location, maybe under ingredients.</li>
			<li>Type for recipe ingredients should maybe be left aligned, centered is hard to read, especially with ingredients where the quantity is important.</li>
			<li>Put the "do ahead"/pro tips section at the beginning of the recipe; would be more helpful to know tips before makinge entire recipe.</li>
			<li>Different send-off, voila is French and does not fit with the recipe.</li>
			<li>Consider a different typeface for body copy; a little bit high contrast at small size.</li>
			<li>+.5 pt up on the leading.</li>
			<li>No need for numbers -- hard return is enough to determine recipe steps from one another.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Plan of Action</h3>
		<p>I plan to take these suggestions into consideration, and think about how I can make my website more user-friendly and easier to read. I think most of the critique were points I agreed with, although I may try to add numbers or another header so I can give greater clarity to the recipe steps. More white space would also help the viewer experience.</p>
