		<p>John met me down on the boulevard</p>
		<p>Cried on his shoulder 'cause life is hard</p>
		<p>The waves came in over my head</p>
		<p>What you been up to, my baby?</p>
		<p>Haven't seen you 'round here lately</p>
		<p>All of the guys tell me lies, but you don't</p>
		<p>You just crack another beer</p>
		<p>And pretend that you're still here</p>

		<p>Joe met me down at the training yard</p>
		<p>Cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard</p>
		<p>I know he's in over his head</p>
		<p>But I love that man like nobody can</p>
		<p>He moves mountains and pounds them to ground again</p>
		<p>I watched the guys getting high as they fight</p>
		<p>For the things that they hold disappear</p>
		<p>To forget the things they fear</p>

		<p>I've got a kid and two cats in the yard</p>
		<p>The California sun and the movie stars</p>
		<p>I watch the skies getting light as I write</p>
		<p>As I think about those years</p>
		<p>As I whisper in your ear</p>
