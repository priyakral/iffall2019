			<h1>Death and Legacy</h1>

			<h2>Death</h2>

		<p class="copy1">On either 10 or 11 June 323 BC, Alexander died in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II, in Babylon, at age
32. There are two different versions of Alexander's death and details of the death differ slightly in
each. Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus,
and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa. He developed a fever,
which worsened until he was unable to speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were
granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them. In the second account, Diodorus recounts
that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles,
followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever and died after some agony.
Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim.</p>

<p class="copy1">Given the propensity of the Macedonian aristocracy to assassination, foul play featured in multiple
accounts of his death. Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian and Justin all mentioned the theory that Alexander was
poisoned. Justin stated that Alexander was the victim of a poisoning conspiracy, Plutarch dismissed it as
a fabrication, while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness. The accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating Antipater, recently
removed as Macedonian viceroy, and at odds with Olympias, as the head of the alleged plot. Perhaps
taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence, and having seen the fate of Parmenion and
Philotas, Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son Iollas, who was
Alexander's wine-pourer. There was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated.</p>
	<h2>After Death</h2>

	<p class="copy1">Alexander's body was laid in a gold anthropoid sarcophagus that was filled with honey, which was in turn placed in a gold casket. According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest "would be happy and unvanquishable forever". Perhaps more likely, the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy, since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative.</p>

	<p class="copy1">While Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis. His successor, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at least late Antiquity. Ptolemy IX Lathyros, one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage. The recent discovery of an enormous tomb in northern Greece, at Amphipolis, dating from the time of Alexander the Great has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander. This would fit with the intended destination of Alexander's funeral cortege.</p>

	<h2>Division of the Empire</h2>

	<p class="copy1">Alexander's death was so sudden that when reports of his death reached Greece, they were not immediately believed. Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir, his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander's death. According to Diodorus, Alexander's companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom; his laconic reply was "tôi kratistôi"—"to the strongest". Another theory is that his successors willfully or erroneously misheard "tôi Kraterôi"—"to Craterus", the general leading his Macedonian troops home and newly entrusted with the regency of Macedonia.</p>

	<p class="copy1">Dissension and rivalry soon afflicted the Macedonians, however. The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the Partition of Babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC, Macedonian unity collapsed, and 40 years of war between "The Successors" (Diadochi) ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocs: Ptolemaic Egypt, Seleucid Mesopotamia and Central Asia, Attalid Anatolia, and Antigonid Macedon. In the process, both Alexander IV and Philip III were murdered.</p>
