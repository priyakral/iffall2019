		<p class="copy1">Alexander III of Macedon, commonly known as Alexander
	the Great, was a king (basileus) of the ancient
	Greek kingdom of Macedon[a] and a member of the
	Argead dynasty. He was born in Pella in 356 BC and
	succeeded his father Philip II to the throne at the age
	of 20. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented
	military campaign through Asia and
	northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty, he had created
	one of the largest empires of the ancient world,
	stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was
	undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of
	history's most successful military commanders.</p>
