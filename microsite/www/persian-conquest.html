			<h1>Persian Conquest</h1>

		<p class="copy1">From Babylon, Alexander went to Susa, one of the Achaemenid capitals, and captured its treasury.[85]
He sent the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Persian Royal Road.
Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. He then stormed the pass of the
Persian Gates (in the modern Zagros Mountains) which had been blocked by a Persian army under Ariobarzanes
and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.[86]</p>

		<p class="copy1">On entering Persepolis, Alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days.[87] Alexander
stayed in Persepolis for five months.[88] During his stay a fire broke out in the eastern palace of Xerxes I
and spread to the rest of the city. Possible causes include a drunken accident or deliberate revenge for
the burning of the Acropolis of Athens during the Second Persian War by Xerxes;[89] Plutarch and Diodorus
allege that Alexander's companion, the hetaera Tha√Øs, instigated and started the fire. Even as he
watched the city burn, Alexander immediately began to regret his decision.[90][91][92] Plutarch claims
that he ordered his men to put out the fires,[90] but that the flames had already spread to most of the
city.[90] Curtius claims that Alexander did not regret his decision until the next morning.[90]</p>

		<p class="copy1">Alexander then chased Darius, first into Media, and then Parthia.[95] The Persian king no longer controlled
his own destiny, and was taken prisoner by Bessus, his Bactrian satrap and kinsman.[96] As Alexander
approached, Bessus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Darius'
successor as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into Central Asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against Alexander.[
97] Alexander buried Darius' remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral.[
98] He claimed that, while dying, Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid
throne.[99] The Achaemenid Empire is normally considered to have fallen with Darius.[100]</p>

		<p class="copy1">Alexander viewed Bessus as a usurper and set out to defeat him. This campaign, initially against Bessus,
turned into a grand tour of central Asia. Alexander founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria,
including modern Kandahar in Afghanistan, and Alexandria Eschate ("The Furthest") in modern Tajikistan.
The campaign took Alexander through Media, Parthia, Aria (West Afghanistan), Drangiana, Arachosia
(South and Central Afghanistan), Bactria (North and Central Afghanistan), and Scythia.[101]</p>
