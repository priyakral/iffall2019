			<li>Priya Kral, majoring in Communication Design, junior.</li>
			<li> I am required to take this class for my BFA, but I am very excited to expand my horizons and learn more about user-centered design! I think this is a  necessary skill to be an informed designer in the 21st century. </li>
			<li> I have no prior experience with HTML/CSS/JS. </li>
			<li>I hope to learn how to think about design in a way that is interactive and not just confined to 2-D.</li>
			<li>I expect that designing for screens will differ than designing for paper because of the change in context. With a screen-based design, a designer has the opportunity to curate the entire screen space, which I believe presents an opportunity for a more immersive experience.</li>
			<li> https://www.ogilvy.com The Ogilvy website exemplifies effective design because it clearly presents the agency and their work in an interactive, visually stimulating, and unique way. There is an option for users to toggle with the largeness of thumbnails depicted on the home screen, and as a viewer uses their mousepad to scroll up, the screen fades out to a gradient that then presents the mission statement.</li>
			<li>https://www.72andsunny.com The website for 72andSunny exemplifies effective communication because viewers are instantly greeted by a screen-wide video of short clips from different advertising campaigns. This makes it clear to the viewer that 72and Sunny is a marketing, advertising, and design company without them explicitly needing to use text to say it.</li>
			<li>https://www.thereformation.com I believe that the website for Reformation works well because it relies on clean, minimalistic, product-focused design. The typeface is an unobtrusive Sans Serif and most of the space is used for images or videos of the products, all of which are separated neatly in a grid-based system by similar attributes. Scrolling over a product also prompts a different image of that product, which is an effective and simple way for a viewer to see an additional image without having to click or be taken to a different webpage.</li>
